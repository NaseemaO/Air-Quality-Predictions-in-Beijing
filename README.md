# Final-Project-4 Group-6. 
Air Quality Predictions in Beijing, China

Project Team: Alex Calametti, Brian Guenther, Gabriela Delgado, Naseema Omer 

Objectives: 
Pediction models / Train algorithm(s) to classify air quality feature(s) / measurements and predict the level of O3, the Target. 
Build additional models to predict other Targets for eg. CO

Model Optimizations.  

Instructions / Check list

from 23.1 pdf
    Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing
    Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
    You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
    You must use at least two of the following: 04
        Python Pandas
        Python Matplotlib
        HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
        JavaScript Plotly
        JavaScript Leaflet
        Tableau
        SQL Database
        MongoDB Database
        Google Cloud SQL
        Amazon AWS

The requirements for this project are broken into 5 categories: (from 23.1 pdf)

Data and data delivery

Back end (ETL)

Visualizations

Group presentations

Slide deck

Final Requirements: (from 23.1 pdg)
    Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm
    Perform a deep dive on existing data using machine learning.
    Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML 
    (use Leaflet or Plotly to change the visualization).
    Create an idea using mock data, and simulate how machine learning might be used.
    Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.


# Process
Data Selection https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data
Download csv files. (in Resource folder)
Import into Panda Data Frames, concatenate the Pandas DataFrames, remove or impute Null rows (if between 5-10% of the total # or rows)
May as example: Export as Parquet file, then use Spark.
